# Healthcare Expenditure, Life Expectancy,
# and Child Mortality

##About
Join me as we investigate healthcare expenditures as they relate to life expectancy and child mortality in developed countries. The Human Development Index (HDI) is a composite score based on many different demographic statistics, such as education level, per capita income, lifespan, gross national income, etc. Based on the HDI, the top 25 developed countries are:
- Australia
- Austria
- Belgium
- Canada
- Denmark
- Finland
- Germany
- Hong Kong
- Iceland
- Ireland
- Israel
- Japan
- Liechtenstein
- Luxembourg
- Malta
- Netherlands
- New Zealand
- Norway
- Singapore
- Slovenia
- South Korea
- Sweden
- Switzerland
- UK
- USA

Specifically, we will be investigating the following variables and how they correlate with each other:
- GDP
- Life expectancy
- Child mortality
- Total healthcare expenditure
- Out of pocket healthcare expenditure

##Data Source

## Installation
First, ensure you’ve met the following requirements:
- Python is installed – this project was developed using Python 3.11.4. If you need to install python or update your version, you can do so here: [Python Official Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Git is installed – you will need Git to clone the repository. If you need to download it, you can do so here: [Git Official Site](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

In order to run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

**Clone the Repository**

- Navigate to the location you want the repository to be cloned using the '''cd''' command in your terminal, or by opening the location in file explorer and typing cmd into the navigation bar to open your terminal in that location.
- Once you have your terminal open in the desired location, use the following command in your terminal:

'''
git clone https://github.com/metrictulip0309/Capstone.git
'''

**Navigate to the Cloned Repository**

Use the '''cd''' command to navigate to the directory where the repository was cloned.

**Set Up and Activate Virtual Environment**

Using a virtual environment will isolate the project from your system's Python environment. The following commands will create a virtual environment called 'venv' in your current directory.

Set Up:
For Windows
'''
python -m venv venv
'''

For macOS or Linux
'''
python3 -m venv venv
'''

Activation:
For Windows
'''
.\venv\Scripts\activate
'''

For macOS or Linux
'''
source venv/bin/activate
'''

**Install Required Packages**

Run the following command to install required packages:
'''
pip install -r requirements.txt

**You are now set up to run the project!**

When you finish, type 'deactivate' into your terminal to deactivate the virtual environment.
